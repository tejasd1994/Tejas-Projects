Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =  10000
ii. Hours =  business_id(foreign key) = 1562
iii. Category = business_id (foreign key) =2643
iv. Attribute = business_id (foreign key) = 1115
v. Review =  id (primary key) = 10000
vi. Checkin = business_id (foreign key) = 493
vii. Photo = id (primary key) = 10000
viii. Tip = user_id (foreign key) = 537
ix. User = id(primary key) 10000 
x. Friend = user_id (foreign key) = 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id (foreign key) = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	No its very difficult to find any corellation between the number of revies and the number of fans.
	ex . A user has 1153 reviews but has only 311 fans , on the other hand another user has 609 review count but has the highest number of fans 503  

SELECT review_count , fans
FROM user
ORDER BY 2 DESC

-------------+------+
| review_count | fans |
+--------------+------+
|          609 |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	I picked 'Charlotte' and category 'Restaurants'. The two restaurants namely 'Subway' and 'Big City Grill' have stars 3.5 and 5 respectively.The Subway opens early 
	at 6 a.m on weekdays and gets closed at 10 p.m  while the 'Big City Grill' opens at 11 am on weekdays and closes on 8 p.m  .On Saturdays Subway opens at 10 a.m and 
	closes at 9 p.m while 'Big City Grill' opens at 11 a.m and closes at 8 p.m.Clearly, Subway open hours are more on weekdays as well as Saturday but customers have 
	given more stars to 'Big City Grill' regardless of their open hours.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
	'Subway' has 7 review count while 'Big City Grill' has 4 review count.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

	
	Both have different address , not much to infer from their address data.




SQL code used for analysis:
SELECT name , city ,stars ,  hours  , review_count, address
FROM business b 
JOIN category c 
ON b.id = c.business_id 
JOIN hours h
ON b.id = h.business_id
WHERE city = 'Charlotte' AND category = 'Restaurants'



		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         Average review count and average star rating for the business which are still open
+-------------------+---------------+
| AVG(review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+-------------------+---------------+
|     31.7570754717 | 3.67900943396 |
+-------------------+---------------+

	Average review count and average star rating for the business which are still closed.
+-------------------+---------------+
| AVG(review_count) |    AVG(stars) |
+-------------------+---------------+
|     23.1980263158 | 3.52039473684 |
+-------------------+---------------+
         
ii. Difference 2:
         There are more business which are open and have more usefull rating than the closed ones.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  AVG(review_count) , AVG(stars)
FROM business 
WHERE is_open = 0

SELECT  AVG(review_count) , AVG(stars)
FROM business 
WHERE is_closed = 0



	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         'predicting the overall star rating for a business'
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I have taken attributes such as the review count , star rating of the reviewer , usefull , funny and cool ratings to predict the number of stars a business has.
The review count is the number of reviewers , star rating is the stars provided by the reviewer. I am taking the average of all the parameters to get the generalized results.
I have joined the review and the business table.I was keen on joining the resulting table with checkin table to see the count of checkins but the join resulted in no rows.
I have grouped the data by the stars of the business.                    
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-------+-------------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| stars | AVG(review_count) |  AVG(r.stars) |    AVG(useful) |     AVG(funny) |      AVG(cool) |

+-------+-------------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+


KEY FINDINGS :

Most number of reviews are going to businesses with 3-4 stars.This means more number of people visit this category of business.
The review count for business with 1 star and 5 star both is less as very less people go to these business.
Business with stars between 2-5 are more usefull.
Business with stars 2.5-4.5 are more cooler.
Higher star rated business have higher reviewer star rating.
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
SELECT b.stars ,AVG(review_count) , AVG(r.stars),AVG(useful) , AVG(funny) , AVG(cool)
FROM business b
JOIN review r
ON b.id = r.business_id
GROUP BY b.stars
